#first we have to import discord

import discord
#then I imported os because I put my bots private token in a different .env file but if you are doing this in a way that you know no one will see this you don't
#have to import os and where it says token you can just paste your bots token there.
import os 

client = discord.Client()
#this tells us when we have sucesfully logged into our bot and took it online.
@client.event
async def on_ready():
  print('We have logged on as {0.user}'.format(client))

  
#this runs the code
client.run(os.getenv('TOKEN'))
